            "content": "The UK governments’ formal accession to the CPTPP trade area this weekend should be the catalyst for the Alliance Party to review its Brexit reversal policy. On Sunday, the Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenock signed a treaty which gives the UK access to the £12 trillion Indo Pacific trade bloc and a chance for the UK to expand beyond the confines of the European Union. Admittedly this is one of the very few trade-deal successes that we have witnessed over the last seven years since Brexit. The CPTPP, also known by the catchy name of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Vietnam and many other Pacific Rim countries. According to a new government report one in every 100 workers are employed in a company headquartered in a CPTPP member state and £35 billion of CPTPP investment is in the South East of England alone. This trading arrangement also presents a positive opportunity for Northern Irish businesses, particularly in manufacturing, machinery and transport equipment. We have some truly awesome companies in Northern Ireland to take advantage of these trading links, including Wrightbus in Ballymena and ALMAC and other manufacturers in the Craigavon area. Even though the Asia Pacific region is arguably the fastest growing area in the world, some have expressed concerns that the CPTPP could eventually weaken produce standards in the UK as companies look to maintain and expand their market share. One example of this is the deviation in food production standards between the EU, UK and CPTPP bloc and the use of pesticides. Whilst there is no immediate requirement for the UK to amend their standards, over time CPTPP encourage alignment. Despite these longer-term risks, membership of the CPTPP should be welcomed in Northern Ireland as it presents more trading opportunities for our businesses. This is also a reason why I believe the Alliance Party should revise its Brexit policy and demonstrate, once again, that it is the grown-up party of business and the centre ground. In its 2022 Assembly Election manifesto the party stated that it wishes to “ re-join the EU at the earliest opportunity ”, however, to realise its other manifesto commitment to “ make Northern Ireland the most innovative and dynamic regional economy in Europe” I believe a change in policy is required. During the EU / UK negotiations Alliance correctly claimed that the EU backstop, the NI Protocol and the Windsor Framework were all the negative out-workings of Brexit, but this debate is now over. I believe the party would be in a much stronger position if it was to solely champion the new opportunities presented by dual market access to both the EU and UK markets by ending its priority to reverse Brexit. As they say, you can’t ride two horses at the same time or can’t have your cake and eat it. Reversing this policy would send a clear message to business and potential investors that Northern Ireland is open for business and can be a successful and growth led economy through the current Windsor Framework agreement. I also believe the Alliance Party is strong enough to withstand a little open debate given the importance of these economic and trading opportunities. Others may take a different view and argue that it is consistent to reject the overriding principle of Brexit while at the same time try and make the best of a bad deal through the Windsor Framework. But I would argue that Alliance can still retain its pro-European stance and be a champion for new trading opportunities. While some of Stormont’s politicians may wish to see equality across the United Kingdom – presumably to free the English, Welsh and Scots from the dastardly consequences of Brexit – I am afraid I do not. Instead, I am selfishly partisan when it comes to Northern Ireland and strongly support access to the EU market and preferential access to the UK market. Entry into the CPTPP trading bloc will also help bolster our trading arrangements through the UK market but it will not diminish our access to the EU market. In 2016 I voted to remain in the EU but have long since accepted the current Brexit reality. Now the Alliance Party should grasp the opportunity to lead the economic debate in Northern Ireland by updating their policy to reverse Brexit.",

            "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 ― Malaysia's palm oil industry will be one of the sectors to benefit from the United Kingdom’s entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), an analyst said. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said Malaysia has successfully sought Britain to cut its palm oil tariffs ― currently ranging up to 12 per cent to nil ― immediately on entering the pact; this should drive more exports to the UK. Bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded US$7.3 billion (RM33.4 billion) in 2022 with the UK recording a trade surplus of some US$786 million (RM3.5 billion). The Malaysian Palm Oil Board anticipates palm oil exports to increase by 3.7 per cent to 16.3 million tonnes in 2023 due to continuous demand from importing countries. “Commodities like rubber (will benefit from the UK’s entry) and possibly an increase in edible fresh foods,” Innes told Bernama, adding that the UK is struggling post-Brexit and is now “operating on an island of its own.” “The UK is not self-sufficient in food production; it imports 48 per cent of the total food consumed and the proportion is rising. Therefore, as a food-trading nation, the UK relies on imports,” Innes said. Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist and social finance head Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid told Bernama that the Malaysia-UK relationship has always been cozy with regards investments. The Battersea Power Station project exemplifies how the two countries assisted and complemented each other to create value. “Many Malaysians had their tertiary education in the UK. Therefore, CPTPP should help to promote two-way trade and investment as the cost of doing business would be more cost-effective post UK’s admission into the pact,” he added. Mohd Afzanizam said the UK needs to be economically friendlier with the rest of the world as it “goes solo” because it needs to access raw materials and labour for production as well as foreign markets. “The CPTPP offers greater exposure to the global economy and it could potentially involve China as it is also in the process to be part of the pact. “While we remain uncertain how China would be admitted considering the existing friction with some member countries, the UK’s aspiration to be part of the club makes economic sense,” Mohd Afzanizam said. The UK is the first European nation to join the bloc since it was created in 2018. The pact comprises fellow G7 members Canada and Japan, UK’s long-standing allies Australia and New Zealand, alongside Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. “However, it is questionable how much this will benefit its economic growth. The UK is a big services economy, and that sector could have some export benefits. Still, I think it aligns better with the UK shoring up supply chains, which could lead to some domestic import cost benefits,” Innes said. On whether the UK's entry would be a bulwark against Chinese dominance in the region, he said that Western countries are looking to circumvent China's supply of goods. “The short answer is probably not so soon, but that will not stop them from rearranging large portions of the globalised economy and this a tall order,” Innes said. ― Bernama",

            "content": "usiness secretary Kemi Badenoch — which countries hope can maximise “post freedoms”. Membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) brings British businesses a step closer to being able to sell to a market of around 500 million people with fewer barriers. The move will see the UK with 11 other countries and gain access to a $10 trillion (£8.1tn) . Ms Badenoch has said Britain will need to maximise the potential of the agreement. “If we don’t use it, then it’ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy,” she said. “This is the fastest growing region. The Asia Pacific is going to be responsible for at least 50 per cent of global growth that we’re expecting between now and 2035.” Prime Minister said joining the CTPPP demonstrated how the UK is able to take advantage of its “post-Brexit freedoms” to strike agreements that were not possible when it was in the EU. However, , with official estimates suggesting it will add just £1.8 billion a year to the economy after 10 years, representing less than one per cent of UK GDP. Eleven countries have combined to make a group that enjoys a free trade agreement. The CPTPP covers virtually all sectors and aspects of , with its sole aim to reduce red tape, take down trade barriers, and facilitate trade business between member countries. Between them, the club’s constituents are home to around 500 million people and generate more than 13 per cent of the world’s income. It was first founded in 2018, with the core members being Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Singapore. In 2019, Vietnam joined, as did Peru in 2021. Malaysia joined in 2022, while Chile signed up in February 2023. The other members of the CPTPP are Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. The UK Government wanted to seal a trade deal now it is outside the European Union. The Government has said joining CPTPP will add even “more economic clout to this exciting and dynamic trade alliance” and allow the country to grow financially while strengthening “our bilateral trade relationships with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore — which total £32bn”. While Britain already has trade agreements with the CPTPP members apart from Malaysia and Brunei, officials said it will deepen existing arrangements, with 99 per cent of current UK goods exports to the bloc eligible for zero tariffs. “What we should be doing is praising the effort it has taken to get us into this regional bloc,” Ms Badenoch told Sky News upon the membership being agreed. “I remember a few years ago people in the UK were laughing, saying this would never happen.” She added that the deal proves the UK is not “isolated”. “The UK is looking outwards, we are not an insular country. We have a seat at the table.” However, she did admit that the chances of a free trade deal with the US are “very low”. With the Conservatives trailing Labour in the polls ahead of an expected general election next year, it is unclear whether the next government will focus as much on the Indo-Pacific as it does on mending Brexit-battered ties with the European Union. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy last month said the Tories were being “dishonest” by claiming CPTPP membership would make up for lost trade in Europe.",

            "description": "Canadian beef and pork farmers are calling on members of Parliament to vote against the U.K.'s membership in a major Asia-Pacific trade group.",
            "content": "Canadian beef and pork farmers frustrated by an ongoing dispute with Britain over meat exports are calling on members of Parliament to vote against the U.K.’s membership in a major Asia-Pacific trade group. “It’s unacceptable,” said Canadian Cattle Association president Nathan Phinney in an interview Monday, two days after an announcement that the U.K. has been granted accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). “We’re not standing behind it, and we will oppose it with everything we have.” The CPTPP, first established in 2018, is a trading bloc made up of Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The agreement encompasses more than 500 million people and 15 per cent of the world’s economy. According to the federal government, Canadian exports to new markets through the CPTPP have increased by more than 35 per cent since 2018, reaching more than $24 billion in 2022. The U.K. — which is Canada’s third-largest single-country trading partner — concluded negotiations in March to enter the CPTPP, making it the newest member of the agreement and the first new country to join since the trading bloc was first established. But the Canadian Cattle Association and the Canadian Pork Council, as well as Canadian meat processors and exporters, say the U.K. does not deserve a place in a bloc dedicated to open trade. The meat industry has been angry for years over what they say is the British government’s refusal to recognize Canada’s food safety and animal health systems — a refusal that has had the effect of severely limiting Canadian beef and pork exports to the U.K. in recent years. One major sticking point is that the U.K. refuses to accept beef treated with growth hormones, a common agricultural practice in Canada. The U.K. also rejects Canada’s use of antimicrobial livestock carcass washes in slaughterhouses. While these are regulatory roadblocks, not tariffs, Canadian industry representatives say they have virtually the same effect. They note that under the post-Brexit agreement that replicates the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union, the U.K. in the past two years has exported more than 7,000 tonnes of beef valued at close to $40 million to Canada. In contrast, Canada exported just 657 tonnes of beef valued at $7.6 million to the U.K. in 2021 and zero beef in 2022. The situation for pork is also lopsided, with the U.K. having shipped 1,300 tonnes of pork valued at $10 million to Canada last year, and Canada shipping zero pork to the U.K. “I think at this juncture there’s just a real frustration,” said Chris White, president and CEO of the Canadian Meat Council, which represents the country’s meat processing plants. “That inequity is something we’re quite concerned about.” While other markets in the CPTPP are far more valuable than the British market to Canadian beef and pork producers (for example, Canada exported $142 million in beef alone to Japan between January and May of this year), White said the industry is concerned a precedent is being set. “Whatever the standards or the thresholds are for the U.K. to join the CPTPP, then that is the bar that is set for other countries to join the CPTPP,” White explained. “If the U.K. gets in and they say, ‘We don’t recognize Canada’s food safety system,’ then how do you make the next country that wants to come in recognize it?” International Trade Minister Mary Ng congratulated the U.K. Saturday on its accession to the CPTPP, saying that the benefits of the trading bloc will grow with the U.K. as a member. Each CPTPP member must still ratify Britain’s membership through a vote in its national legislature. Canada and Britain are also currently separately negotiating a bilateral trade deal, and “continue to push for Canadian agricultural interests, including commercially meaningful access for pork and beef,” said Ng’s press secretary Shanti Cosentino in an email. However, British High Commissioner to Canada Susannah Goshko said in an interview earlier this spring that the U.K. will not back down on issues such as the use of growth hormones. She went so far as to suggest that Canadian ranchers should consider changing their farming practices if they want access for their beef to the U.K. market. That’s a proposal Phinney, of the Canadian Cattle Association, strongly rejects. “We have the science behind us. We have a world-class food safety system and a world-class product,” he said. “A lot of this has been politicized in the U.K., and you know, to be quite blunt, it’d be nice to see our Canadian government stand up for its producers the way the U.K. is standing up for theirs.” Phinney added that if the federal government doesn’t reject the U.K.’s membership in the trading bloc through a vote in Parliament, it should be prepared to financially compensate farmers and processors for the losses that will result.",

            "description": "If a conversation turns to the topic of trade, Nathan Phinney isn’t willing to pull his verbal punches. Phinney, the Canadian Cattle Association president, said Britain joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership is bad news for livestock producers. “The Canadian beef industry is built on trade and export and we’re a strong advocate, when it comes to good trade deals,” Phinney said from his farm near Sackville, N.B. “When we’re saying it’s a bad trade deal and bad for Canadian producers, that’s a red flag.” Phinney and others in Canada’s red meat industry are disappointed and frustrated that Canada is welcoming the United Kingdom into a CPTPP — an agreement between Pacific nations and now Britain. Last weekend at a signing ceremony in New Zealand, Britain became the 12th member of the trade pact, joining Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Mary Ng, Canada’s minister of international trade, issued a news release July 15 welcoming Britain into the CPTPP. The federal government may want Britain in the deal, but the Canadian Pork Council, Canadian Cattle Association and the Canadian Meat Council do not. “The main area of concern for our industry is the failure to accept Canada’s meat inspection system, widely recognized as one of the finest in the world,” the three groups said. “The U.K. does not accept Canada’s food safety and animal health systems and measures, and those non-tariff barriers limit our access to the U.K. market.” The organizations say letting Britain into CPTPP is a repeat of a previous trade mistake. In 2015, Canada signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Europe and assumed the Europeans would sort out the details of meat trade, after the fact. That didn’t happen. Trade barriers are still in place, as Europe doesn’t recognize the safety of Canada’s food production system. “Everyone in the world knows that Europe is hard to trade with,” said Stephen Heckbert, Canadian Pork Council executive director. “Europe and the U.K. are a bit professional when it comes to non-tariff trade barriers. They’re just really good at it. They always find ways of keeping an unfair balance in the market.” As a result, since CETA was signed in 2017, Canadian pork exports to Europe have dropped to nothing. And beef exports have climbed modestly to $22 million. Meanwhile, EU pork and beef shipments to Canada reached $399 million in 2022. Phinney said cattle producers are frustrated by the recent decision to let Britain into the CPTPP, because it’s part of a trend where the government doesn’t defend Canada’s food production system. In this case, Canada is allowing Britain to join the CPTPP, despite the U.K. position that Canada’s food system is unsafe. “Our government is moving ahead with it. Instead of completely road-blocking it and saying until these issues are resolved, we are not supporting it,” Phinney said. “(If the government did that) all 60,000 beef farmers across the country would be supporting that.” A spokesperson for Ng said the federal government is pushing the U.K. on fair access to its market. “We are working closely side by side with industry towards solutions that meet the needs of Canadian producers, workers, and the communities they support,” said Shanti Cosentino. While Canadian farmers are unhappy, the British National Farmers Union supports the U.K. joining the CPTPP. As long as Canadian beef and pork are kept out. “I am pleased that our government continues to maintain its commitment to our food safety standards,” said U.K. NFU president Minette Batters. “It is an absolute red line for us that food produced using practices that are illegal here — for instance, the use of hormones in beef and pork production and chemical washes for carcases — should not be allowed on our market.” Such positions are not based on science, Heckbert said. “Let’s not start a story (through) the U.K. and the EU, that somehow they have better standards.

The pork and beef organizations will lobby politicians to vote against the legislation. “Canadian beef producers cannot support the accession of the U.K. into CPTPP until our bilateral trade barriers with the U.K. are addressed,” Phinney said. “We’re expected to just carry on and move forward.

            "content": "Resources & Agriculture Canadian meat industry angling to exclude U.K. from free trade bloc The Canadian Pork Council, the Canadian Cattle Association and the Canadian Meat Council strongly oppose Britain joining the CPTPP By Robert Arnason , The Western Producer | July 17, 2023, 4:00pm “The main area of concern for our industry is the failure to accept Canada's meat inspection system, widely recognized as one of the finest in the world,” says joint statement from industry players. | Fevziie Ryman / iStock / Getty Images Plus / Getty Images / Getty Images If a conversation turns to the topic of trade, Nathan Phinney isn’t willing to pull his verbal punches. Phinney, the Canadian Cattle Association president, said Britain joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership is bad news for livestock producers. “The Canadian beef industry is built on trade and export and we’re a strong advocate, when it comes to good trade deals,” Phinney said from his farm near Sackville, N.B. “When we’re saying it’s a bad trade deal and bad for Canadian producers, that’s a red flag.” Phinney and others in Canada’s red meat industry are disappointed and frustrated that Canada is welcoming the United Kingdom into a CPTPP — an agreement between Pacific nations and now Britain. Last weekend at a signing ceremony in New Zealand, Britain became the 12th member of the trade pact, joining Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Mary Ng, Canada’s minister of international trade, issued a news release July 15 welcoming Britain into the CPTPP. The federal government may want Britain in the deal, but the Canadian Pork Council, Canadian Cattle Association and the Canadian Meat Council do not. “The main area of concern for our industry is the failure to accept Canada’s meat inspection system, widely recognized as one of the finest in the world,” the three groups said. “The U.K. does not accept Canada’s food safety and animal health systems and measures, and those non-tariff barriers limit our access to the U.K. market.” The organizations say letting Britain into CPTPP is a repeat of a previous trade mistake. In 2015, Canada signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Europe and assumed the Europeans would sort out the details of meat trade, after the fact. That didn’t happen. Trade barriers are still in place, as Europe doesn’t recognize the safety of Canada’s food production system. “Everyone in the world knows that Europe is hard to trade with,” said Stephen Heckbert, Canadian Pork Council executive director. “Europe and the U.K. are a bit professional when it comes to non-tariff trade barriers. They’re just really good at it. They always find ways of keeping an unfair balance in the market.” As a result, since CETA was signed in 2017, Canadian pork exports to Europe have dropped to nothing. And beef exports have climbed modestly to $22 million. Meanwhile, EU pork and beef shipments to Canada reached $399 million in 2022. Phinney said cattle producers are frustrated by the recent decision to let Britain into the CPTPP, because it’s part of a trend where the government doesn’t defend Canada’s food production system. In this case, Canada is allowing Britain to join the CPTPP, despite the U.K. position that Canada’s food system is unsafe. “Our government is moving ahead with it. Instead of completely road-blocking it and saying until these issues are resolved, we are not supporting it,” Phinney said. “(If the government did that) all 60,000 beef farmers across the country would be supporting that.” A spokesperson for Ng said the federal government is pushing the U.K. on fair access to its market. “We are working closely side by side with industry towards solutions that meet the needs of Canadian producers, workers, and the communities they support,” said Shanti Cosentino. While Canadian farmers are unhappy, the British National Farmers Union supports the U.K. joining the CPTPP. As long as Canadian beef and pork are kept out. “I am pleased that our government continues to maintain its commitment to our food safety standards,” said U.K. NFU president Minette Batters. “It is an absolute red line for us that food produced using practices that are illegal here — for instance, the use of hormones in beef and pork production and chemical washes for carcases — should not be allowed on our market.” Such positions are not based on science, Heckbert said. “Let’s not start a story (through) the U.K. and the EU, that somehow they have better standards. They don’t…. Japan has the highest food safety standards in the world and they love our pork.” For Britain to join the CPTPP, Canada and other nations must pass legislation to make it official. The pork and beef organizations will lobby politicians to vote against the legislation. “Canadian beef producers cannot support the accession of the U.K. into CPTPP until our bilateral trade barriers with the U.K. are addressed,” Phinney said. “We’re expected to just carry on and move forward.

The trade bloc covers more than 500 million people and 15% of the world's economy. For Britain, it represents the largest trade deal it has struck since leaving the European Union more than three years ago. Britain first announced in March it had reached an agreement to join the bloc, which was created in 2018, after more than two years of negotiations. It is the first new member to join the bloc, called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). It also includes New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Britain Claims Post-Brexit Win by Sealing Trans-Pacific Trade Pact Membership \"We are honored to become the CPTPP's first new member and to join this extraordinary community of now 12 economies spanning Asia, the Pacific and now Europe,' said British Trade Minister Kemi Badenoch. \"This is a modern and ambitious agreement, and our membership of this exciting, growing and forward-looking bloc is proof that the U.K.'s doors are open for business.\" Badenoch said that more than half a million Britons already work for companies from the bloc's member nations. Shigeyuki Goto, Japan's economic minister, said adding Britain would strengthen the bloc. \"The fact that this was done in a way that maintains the high standards of agreement sets an exemplary precedent for future accessions,\" Goto said. The deal comes as Britain pursues greater engagement with the Indo-Pacific. Critics say the deal is insignificant compared to Britain's trade with its neighbors in the 27-nation EU. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the addition of Britain to the bloc was great news for the region. \"Trade is not only a priority for this government, but is essential to our economic recovery, and improving the lives and livelihoods of all New Zealanders,\" Hipkins said. Since leaving the EU, Britain has also signed separate trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. The U.S. is not part of the bloc after former President Donald Trump withdrew from its predecessor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. China has applied to join the bloc.",
