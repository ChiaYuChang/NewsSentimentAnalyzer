The exercise is part of Taiwan's week-long massive wargames -- the annual \"Han Kuang\" (Han Glory) drills -- which this year has included protecting civilian airports as Beijing ramps up military and political pressures on the island. This is the first such drill held at Taiwan's biggest airport near the capital since it opened in 1979. Military expert Alexander Huang said Taiwan is drawing experiences from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which last year fended off a seizure by Russian paratroopers at the Antonov airport just outside Kyiv. \"Seizing an adversary's airport is key to sending in large numbers of assault forces via air transport in an invasion operation,\" Huang, at Taipei's Tamkang University, said. \"In addition to familiarising our forces with command and control, this drill can also signal to potential enemies that we are getting ourselves prepared for such contingency,\" he told AFP. As air traffic was halted for about 30 minutes, dozens of soldiers fought off \"enemies\" landing on the airport's tarmac from attack helicopters. Airport police and firefighters also joined the operation, which the government said is aimed at combining civilian and military forces to protect critical infrastructure. China, which regards Taiwan as its territory, has upped the pressure in recent years, with near-daily warplane incursions and Chinese vessels deployed around the island's waters. Taiwan has always held frequent military drills, but in recent months increased the civilian component. This week, as the army holds various exercises across the island, local governments are also holding air raid drills in different cities. \"We need to start from the concept of a 'whole-society defence', to integrate and utilise the resources of the military, central government, local governments and civilian sectors, and to coordinate all units to work together,\" said Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, during her visit to a drill at an oil refinery in Taoyuan. Dressed in fatigues and wearing a mask -- she was diagnosed with Covid this week, though has mild symptoms -- Tsai watched on as soldiers fended off \"attack agents\" that parachuted out of helicopters. \"The protection of the oil refinery was incorporated into this Han Kuang exercise to simulate possible attacks or disasters to establish comprehensive contingency measures, and effectively protect our critical infrastructure,\" Tsai said. A drill was initially scheduled at an airport in Taiwan's southeast Taitung Tuesday, but was cancelled due to Typhoon Doksuri.

            "content": "Typhoon Doksuri slammed an island and lashed northern Philippine provinces with ferocious wind and rain Wednesday, displacing nearly 16,000 villagers as it blew tin roofs off rural houses, flooded low-lying villages and knocked out power, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties after the typhoon slammed into Fuga Island off Aparri town in Cagayan province, where 15,843 people were evacuated from high-risk coastal villages. Schools and workplaces were shut down as a precaution as Doksuri approached. Thousands of people in other northern provinces were also displaced by the typhoon, which has a 700-kilometer-wide (435-mile-wide) band of wind and rain. Doksuri weakened slightly but remained dangerous and lethal with sustained winds of 175 kph (109 mph) and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph). It was blowing over the coastal waters of the Babuyan Islands in Luzon Strait off Aparri town Wednesday morning, forecasters said. “Our northern coastal towns are being battered,” Cagayan Gov. Manuel Mamba told The Associated Press by telephone. “I’m receiving reports of tin roofs being blown away and flooding that could not drain out probably because of tidal surges coming in from the sea.” A damage assessment would be done after the typhoon passes, but Mamba said he feared there could be extensive damage to Cagayan valley’s corn and rice farms, which have already been battered by a monthslong dry spell before Doksuri hit. At least four entire towns lost power due to the onslaught and six bridges were impassable due to flooding, Cagayan officials said in an initial damage report. “Violent, life-threatening conditions are expected to continue” on Wednesday over northwestern Cagayan and the outlying Babuyan Islands as well as the northern mountainous regions of Apayao and Ilocos Norte provinces, according to an advisory from the country’s weather bureau. Coast guard personnel used rubber boats and ropes to evacuate villagers, who were trapped by brownish, waist-level floodwaters in their houses in a village in Bacarra town in Ilocos Norte, said the coast guard. More than 3,700 inter-island ferry passengers and cargo truck drivers, along with nearly 100 passenger and cargo vessels and motor bancas, were stranded in several ports where a no-sail order was imposed, the Philippine coast guard said. Disaster-response officials said they were verifying reports of a woman drowning in a swollen creek amid heavy rains Monday in Cardona town southeast of Manila as the typhoon approached from the Pacific. The typhoon has been enhancing seasonal monsoon rains in central and northern provinces, including in the densely populated capital region of metropolitan Manila. It was forecast to move away from the northern Philippines on Thursday and barrel northwestward to graze past ’s southwestern coast before hitting southeastern later this week. Although it is not poised for a direct hit, Doksuri's outer bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to Taiwan’s eastern coast Wednesday. Trains were canceled between Kaohsiung and Taitung cities in the south, while ferries to outlying islands have also been put on pause. Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau reported gusts up to 198 kph (123 mph). Meanwhile, Taiwan has continued to hold its annual Han Kuang military exercises. The military carried out its first-ever drill at the civilian Taoyuan International Airport on Wednesday morning, according to local media. The drill stopped air traffic for an hour while the military simulated stopping an invasion targeted at the airport. ___ AP reporter Huizhong Wu contributed from Taipei, Taiwan. ___ Find more of AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",

Self-ruled Taiwan holds frequent defence drills in the face of increasing military and political pressures from China, which regards the island as its territory. Preparation efforts also extend to its civilian population, with authorities stepping up drills in cities, citing lessons learned from Russia's invasion of Ukraine where the street-to-street warfare appears to be part of the defence strategy playbook. \"Because of the ongoing Ukraine-Russian war, the importance of the drill is for our residents to know how to evacuate,\" said Tsai Yin-fong, who organised Monday's evacuation in Taipei's Neihu district. Residents in seven counties across northern Taiwan were subjected to emergency scenarios as part of Taiwan's \"Wan An\" air defence exercises, which translates to \"everlasting peace\". As the sirens sounded in Neihu to signal an incoming missile attack, volunteers guided residents to nearby underground evacuation shelters, where they crouched to the ground and covered their eyes and ears. In Taipei's southeastern Nangang district, firefighters simulated putting out a blaze caused by a missile attack on a train station, aiming their hoses at the building, and then rescuing a civilian from it. Government employee Wu Kai-te, who had hidden in an underground parking lot as part of the drill, said these exercises were necessary because of China's military threats. \"Taiwan's international situation is more special because of the China factor,\" the 37-year-old told AFP. \"It's very practical for the public and it teaches us the right poses to take to avoid more damage during a missile attack.\" The air raid drills will continue across Taiwan until Thursday. Taiwan is also currently holding its largest annual military drills, known as \"Han Kuang\" (Han Glory), to simulate how it would fend off an attack from Beijing's army. Fighter jets and transport planes took off Monday from bases across the island, with Taiwan's defence ministry saying that the exercises \"showcased the formidable capabilities of our air force\". But drills scheduled for Tuesday in the southern Taitung airport were cancelled as Typhoon Doksuri in Southeast Asia edges closer to Taiwan. Beijing's sabre-rattling against Taiwan has intensified in recent years, with near-daily incursions by warplanes into the island's air defence zone. The Chinese military has also held two massive drills in waters around Taiwan, simulating targeted strikes and a blockade of the island. The air raid drills will continue across Taiwan until Thursday, with some of the public required to stay indoors while drivers or passengers caught in it having to evacuate their vehicles AFP REGISTER FOR FREE to continue reading ✔️ Unlock the full content of International Business Times UK for free offer available for a limited time only ✔️ Easily manage your Newsletters subscriptions and save your favourite articles ✔️ No payment method required Already have an account?
