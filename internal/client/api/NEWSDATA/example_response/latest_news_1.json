            "content": "Manila, Jul 26 (EFE).- At least one person has been killed and over 180,000 have been affected by the impact of super-typhoon Doskuri in the Philippines, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said Wednesday. The typhoon, christened Egay in the Philippines, continues to lash northern parts of the Luzon island, which includes capital Manila, with strong winds and heavy rains that have triggered flooding and landslides. Around 180,439 people from the Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas, North Mindanao, and Soccsksargen regions have been affected by the typhoon, out of which 9,000 have had to abandon their houses, the NDDRMC added. The Philippine meteorological agency, PAGASA, has warned that violent and deadly conditions were expected to continue on the island of Babuyan, northern Luzon and the Apayos and Ilocos Norte regions over the next few hours. Similarly, it predicted that storms caused by the typhoon could trigger floods of up to three meters in the coastal region in northern Luzon. The Philippine weather department, which expects Egay to stop affecting national territory by Thursday morning, had on Tuesday raised the typhoon’s alert level to the highest five, classifying it as a super-typhoon. Meanwhile, China on Wednesday issued a red alert – the highest in its four-color alert system – as Doksuri approaches its southern coast, marking the fifth super-typhoon to form in the region this year. According to the China Meteorological Administration, the storm is expected to hit the coastal areas of the southern Fujian and Guangdong provinces on Friday morning. The typhoon, with maximum wind speeds of 209 kilometers per hour near the eye, was located on Wednesday in the Bashi Channel, a strait between Philippines’ Y’Ami Island and Taiwan’s Orchid Island.

            "content": "Taiwan staged its first-ever military drill at Taoyuan International Airport on Wednesday, briefly halting commercial traffic as soldiers practised defending the facility against a simulated attack by Beijing. The exercise is part of Taiwan’s week-long massive wargames — the annual “Han Kuang” (Han Glory) drills — which this year has included protecting civilian airports as Beijing ramps up military and political pressures on the island. This is the first such drill held at Taiwan’s biggest airport near the capital since it opened in 1979. Analysts said Taiwan is drawing experiences from Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which last year fended off a seizure by Russian paratroopers at an airport just outside Kyiv. “Seeing the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the Battle of Antonov Airport is a successful counter-offensive of the Ukrainian forces in the defence of Kyiv,” said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research. He added that Taoyuan airport’s proximity to a “red beach” — using a term for a potential landing point for amphibious assaults — makes it especially important to protect it. “If it were to be seized by China, Chinese paratroopers would join the attack against our troops guarding the beach,” Su told AFP. Alexander Huang, a military expert at Taipei’s Tamkang University, said the seizure of “an adversary’s airport is key to sending in large numbers of assault forces via air transport in an invasion operation”. He added there was an extra incentive for the Taoyuan drill, besides familiarising Taiwan’s troops with emergency scenarios. “This drill can also signal to potential enemies that we are getting ourselves prepared for such contingency,” Huang told AFP. As air traffic was halted for about 30 minutes, dozens of soldiers fought off “enemies” landing on the airport’s tarmac from attack helicopters. Airport police and firefighters also joined the operation, which the government said is aimed at combining civilian and military forces to protect critical infrastructure. At the end of it, a soldier climbed a ramp and waved Taiwan’s national flag, signalling victory, as “bodies” were littered nearby. China, which regards Taiwan as its territory, has upped the pressure in recent years, with near-daily warplane incursions and Chinese vessels deployed around the island’s waters. The Chinese military has also held two massive drills in waters around Taiwan in the past year, simulating targeted strikes and a blockade of the island. – ‘Whole society defence’ – Taiwan holds frequent military drills, but has in recent months increased the civilian component. This week, local governments are conducting air raid drills in different cities. Troops also conducted an exercise at Taipei’s main train station — a key infrastructure point in the capital — while another drill was held at an oil refinery in Taoyuan. “We need to start from the concept of a ‘whole-society defence’, to integrate and utilise the resources of the military, central government, local governments and civilian sectors, and to coordinate all units to work together,” said Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, during a visit to the oil refinery where she watched soldiers fend off “attack agents” that parachuted out of helicopters. “The protection of the oil refinery was incorporated into this Han Kuang exercise to simulate possible attacks or disasters to establish comprehensive contingency measures, and effectively protect our critical infrastructure,” Tsai said. An airport drill was initially scheduled in Taiwan’s southeast Taitung Tuesday, but was cancelled due to Typhoon Doksuri. The typhoon — which killed at least one person in northern Philippines — is currently expected to bypass the island as it moves north to mainland China.

Doksuri, the fifth typhoon this year, is expected to hit the coastal areas of the southern Fujian and Guangdong provinces on Friday morning, the China Meteorological Administration said on Wednesday morning. The typhoon, with maximum wind speeds of 209 kilometers per hour near the eye, was located on Wednesday in the Bashi Channel, a strait between Philippines’ Y’Ami Island and Taiwan’s Orchid Island. The agency said that the typhoon was expected to move northwest at a speed of 10-15 kilometers per hour, with little change in intensity. Local authorities estimate that the typhoon, the first to trigger the highest warning level this year, may be the strongest to hit eastern Guangdong in the last decade. Amid this scenario, the province has upgraded its typhoon emergency response to Level III- the third highest -, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. South Asia expects Doksuri to bring torrential downpours and strong winds in some areas so a warning has been issued to ships and workers operating in nearby seas to return to ports in time to seek shelter. The city of Shantou in eastern Guangdong will suspend some high-speed train services between Wednesday and Sunday as a precautionary measure. The arrival of the typhoon in the vicinity of Taiwan has already led to the cancellation of some parts of its largest annual military drills. EFE gbm/pd",

The agency warned of \"violent, life-threatening conditions\" as severe winds and heavy rain pounded the lightly populated region. A woman selling bread rolls died when she was hit by a falling coconut tree in Ramon municipality in the northern province of Isabela on Wednesday, provincial disaster official Constante Foronda told AFP. Rey Aguinaldo, a retired government official in the coastal municipality of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte province, said, \"The wind and rain were so strong overnight I could not sleep well.\" \"When I got up today I saw fallen trees and broken branches outside. We have no electricity,\" Aguinaldo told AFP. Doksuri had been a super typhoon as it swept across the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday but weakened as it neared the Philippines. It is expected to weaken further as it moves across the South China Sea, grazing Taiwan as it heads towards southeast China. High waves lashed Taiwan's southeastern coast on Wednesday, with the Central Weather Bureau issuing warnings and heavy rain advisories. China also issued its highest alert for Doksuri, stopping trains and calling fishing boats to shore as the storm approaches. It is expected to weaken before it makes landfall on Friday morning. In the Philippines, around 12,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Cagayan province, including 431 in the Babuyan islands, following warnings of three-meter storm surges, Cagayan provincial disaster official Ruelie Rapsing told AFP. Dalupiri is one of the five islands that make up the tiny Babuyan archipelago. Flooding has also been reported in the coastal municipalities of Lallo, Pamplona and Claveria. About 1,500 people were also evacuated from coastal communities in neighboring Isabela, Foronda said. \"We won't allow them to go home until we get the all clear from the experts,\" he said. Some evacuees have sheltered with neighbors who had concrete houses, while others were taken to municipal halls. \"The roof of the Sanchez Mira municipal hall was blown off,\" Rapsing said. \"The windows of an evacuation center there also broke so we had to move them to multi-purpose halls back in their villages.\" The weather agency also warned the typhoon had intensified the seasonal southwest monsoon, bringing heavy rains across the rest of Luzon and the central islands. © 2023 AFP",

            "content": "TAOYUAN, Taiwan — Taiwan’s Taoyuan International Airport became the scene of a simulated Chinese invasion on Wednesday for the first time ever as the island’s military conducted an anti-takeover drill to fend off any possible attack from Beijing. The drill was designed to test the Taiwanese military’s cross-branch coordination and emergency response capabilities during a simulated Chinese invasion, the Ministry of National Defense previously said. With military helicopters in the sky and soldiers on the tarmac, the drill at Taiwan’s busiest international gateway reflects how Taipei is preparing for multiple scenarios in the face of fears over China’s increased military intimidation – concerns which have amplified since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began last year. China’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory despite never having controlled it, and has spent decades trying to isolate it diplomatically. Beijing has not ruled out using force to take control of Taiwan, and has been putting growing military pressure on Taipei by sending aircraft into its self-declared air defense identification zone and warships in waters around the island. Airports, civilian or otherwise, are primary targets, as was vividly displayed by Moscow’s ultimately unsuccessful attempt to seize Kyiv’s Hostomel Airport in the opening stages of their invasion last year. At Taoyuan on Wednesday, soldiers wearing red helmets to mark themselves as simulated infiltrators engaged in a shootout drill with airport police. Firefighters also practiced putting out simulated fires. Military choppers simulated flying over the airport and deploying enemy troops on the tarmac. As they approached an airport building, they exchanged fire along the way with the Taiwanese military defending the facility and those hiding in makeshift covers. The drills, which lasted for 30 minutes, wrapped up as the Taiwanese military practiced clearing out residual enemy forces, brandishing Taiwan’s flag in the end to signify their simulated successful defense of the airport. The airport drill was newly added to the Han Kuang military exercise held annually since 1984 and involving all branches of Taiwan’s military – including its reserve forces – in an effort to boost overall defense capabilities. Airspace control measures were imposed during the drill, with planes temporarily prohibited from landing or taking off, a Taoyuan International Airport spokesperson told CNN. There was “no major impact” on passengers after the airport adjusted schedules for eight flights, the spokesperson added. Elsewhere, Taiwan’s military canceled some Han Kuang exercises as Typhoon Doksuri made landfall in the northern Philippines on Wednesday. The storm’s outer bands are beginning to impact eastern Taiwan, according to the island’s Central Weather Bureau and is set to press on toward the island and China in the coming days. Taiwan’s Air Force decided to call of the drills at Taitung’s Fengnian airport on its eastern shores on Tuesday due to “safety concerns” as the typhoon approached, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement Monday. — CNN < Previous Page Next Page >",

            "content": "MANILA, July 26 — A powerful storm pounded the northern Philippines today, killing at least one person, toppling trees and knocking out power as thousands sheltered with neighbours or in emergency evacuation centres. Typhoon Doksuri was packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 175 kilometres an hour as it hovered over waters around Dalupiri Island, off the northern tip of the main island of Luzon, the state weather agency said in its latest update at 11am. The agency warned of “violent, life-threatening conditions” as severe winds and heavy rain pounded the lightly populated region. A woman selling bread rolls died when she was hit by a falling coconut tree in Ramon municipality in the northern province of Isabela on Wednesday, provincial disaster official Constante Foronda told AFP. Rey Aguinaldo, a retired government official in the coastal municipality of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte province, said: “The wind and rain were so strong overnight I could not sleep well.” “When I got up today I saw fallen trees and broken branches outside. We have no electricity,” Aguinaldo told AFP. Doksuri had been a super typhoon as it swept across the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday but weakened as it neared the Philippines. It is expected to weaken further as it moves across the South China Sea, grazing Taiwan as it heads towards southeast China. High waves lashed Taiwan’s southeastern coast on Wednesday, with the Central Weather Bureau issuing warnings and heavy rain advisories. China also issued its highest alert for Doksuri, stopping trains and calling fishing boats to shore as the storm approaches. It is expected to weaken before it makes landfall on Friday morning. Thousands flee homes In the Philippines, around 12,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Cagayan province, including 431 in the Babuyan islands, following warnings of three-metre storm surges, Cagayan provincial disaster official Ruelie Rapsing told AFP. Dalupiri is one of the five islands that make up the tiny Babuyan archipelago. Flooding has also been reported in the coastal municipalities of Lallo, Pamplona and Claveria. About 1,500 people were also evacuated from coastal communities in neighbouring Isabela, Foronda said. “We won’t allow them to go home until we get the all clear from the experts,” he said. Some evacuees have sheltered with neighbours who had concrete houses, while others were taken to municipal halls. “The roof of the Sanchez Mira municipal hall was blown off,” Rapsing said. “The windows of an evacuation centre there also broke so we had to move them to multi-purpose halls back in their villages.” The weather agency also warned the typhoon had intensified the seasonal southwest monsoon, bringing heavy rains across the rest of Luzon and the central islands. — AFP",
