            "description": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has told top Vietnamese officials that Washington considers building strong economic and security ties with Vietnam a priority. Yellen visited an electric scooter and battery factory outside Hanoi on Thursday as part of an itinerary…",
            "content": "HANOI (AP) — The U.S. considers building strong economic and security ties with Vietnam a priority, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday as she met with Vietnamese officials in a visit aimed at fortifying America's relations across Asia. Yellen arrived in Vietnam after visits to and to , where she attended financial meetings of the Group of 20 major industrial economies. “The United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Yellen told Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, according to remarks provided by the U.S. Treasury Department. A “free and open Indo-Pacific” refers to the latest iteration of broad U.S. diplomacy aimed at cultivating stronger ties with other countries in the region to counter China's growing sway among its neighbors. “Vietnam is also a close economic partner, with our two-way trade reaching record highs last year and the United States serving as Vietnam’s largest export market,” Yellen said. “It is a priority for our administration to deepen our economic and security ties with Vietnam in the months and years to come.” Yellen briefly sat atop a bright red electric scooter during a visit to a factory in Hanoi's lush green suburbs, where Selex Motors, a five-year-old Vietnamese startup, makes EV scooters and batteries. Climate change poses an existential threat to the world but also provides a “key economic opportunity” and way to build “greater resilience into our economies,\" she said, describing the facility as “impressive.” Yellen said the U.S. recognized the importance of diversifying supply chains after experiencing the disruptions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “And then, when Russia invaded Ukraine, many countries saw what the implications could be of being overly dependent — in Europe's case for natural gas and oil — on a country that could use it for geopolitical ends,” she said. She said the U.S. was actively trying to promote green resilience in supply chains. That doesn't mean ending trading relationships with China, she said, reiterating comments she has voiced before. “But we do partner with more countries. And we see Vietnam as an excellent partner,” she said. Yellen said the U.S. is committed to mobilizing $15 billion to support Vietnam's adoption of renewable energy as a part of the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP — a financial promise made by the Group of Seven advanced economies to help the country phase out its reliance on fossil fuels. Such projects have offered similar incentives to South Africa and Indonesia. Speaking earlier to a group of business women and economists, Yellen said she was encouraged by growing investments in Vietnam in industries including computer chips and renewable energy. Yellen's visit is part of concerted U.S. efforts to balance China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. Earlier this year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Vietnam weeks after the 50th anniversary of the U.S. troop withdrawal that marked the end of America’s direct military involvement in Vietnam. He to boost relations to new levels. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were only restored in 1995. Since then, bilateral trade has grown, reaching a high of $138 billion in goods trade last year. “We have worked closely to address the legacies of the war,” Yellen said. China’s border is less than 60 miles (96 kilometers) from Hanoi and Vietnam, like many of China’s neighbors, has had maritime and territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. The two sides fought a brief war in 1979. But China is Vietnam’s biggest trading partner. Yellen also met Thursday with the governor of Vietnam's central bank, Nguyen Thi Hong, and announced a new economic policy dialogue between the State Bank of Vietnam and the U.S. Treasury Department. She thanked Nguyen for the “close cooperation” between the U.S. and the State Bank of Vietnam to address American over Vietnam's currency practices. She added that the U.S. would remain supportive of Vietnam's growth and that this would be beneficial for both Vietnamese and American people. Vietnam has quickly become a major export production hub for global manufacturers like South Korea's LG and Samsung Electronics, suppliers to Apple, Inc. and auto makers like Honda and Toyota.

            "content": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: IRS whistleblowers lash out at federal officials in Hunter Biden hearing IRS whistleblowers lashed out at federal officials in a Hunter Biden hearing. Plus, the president of Stanford is resigning amid allegations of unethical research conduct, USA TODAY Pentagon Correspondent Tom Vanden Brook explains how climate change in the Arctic is affecting national security, leaked emails allege Texas patrol agents were ordered to push migrants into the Rio Grande, and USA TODAY Sports Columnist Nancy Armour previews the World Cup . Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here Hit play on the player above to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript below. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 20th of July 2023. Today, IRS whistleblowers speak out about Hunter Biden. Plus, the president of Stanford steps down after problems were found in his research, and we look at how extreme heat in Alaska is impacting national security. ♦ Two IRS whistleblowers gave Congress their side of the story yesterday from a year's long investigation into Hunter Biden. Speaking at a joint hearing, Internal Revenue Service employees Greg Shapely and Joseph Ziegler alleged that Justice Department officials slow walked their investigation into the President's youngest son. Ziegler said, \"It appeared to me, based on what I experienced, that the US attorney in Delaware in our investigation was constantly hamstrung, limited, and marginalized by officials, as well as other US attorneys.\" It was the first public testimony from the two IRS agents assigned to the case, which focused on gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden. He ultimately pled guilty to two misdemeanor accounts of tax evasion and agreed to participate in a pretrial program in June. ♦ The president of Stanford University announced his resignation yesterday set for the end of August. Marc Tessier-Lavigne stepping down comes after the school's board of trustees launched a review in December following allegations that he engaged in fraud and other unethical conduct related to research and papers that were up to two decades old. Panelists found multiple cases of manipulated data in the papers they investigated. They found that Tessier-Lavigne, who's a neuroscientist, was not responsible for the misconduct, but that he was the principal author in several papers where there was apparent manipulation. He said he's \"never submitted a scientific paper without firmly believing that the data were correct and accurately presented.\" But he said that he should have been more diligent in seeking corrections for his work and should have had tighter controls in his laboratory. ♦ Extreme heat from climate change is baking Alaska, and that's creating a host of national security problems. I spoke with USA TODAY Pentagon Correspondent Tom Vanden Brook to learn more. Thanks for hopping on Tom. Tom Vanden Brook: Good to be here Taylor. Taylor Wilson: So Tom, starting here, how exactly is climate change impacting the Alaskan Arctic? Tom Vanden Brook: In a number of ways, Taylor. One of the principle ways most immediately is rising sea levels have damaged coastal radar sites in Alaska. The kinds that people would be aware of are the types that picked up the Chinese spy balloon that entered over the Aleutian Islands in January. So they've spent tens of millions of dollars to repair sea walls and sort of arm these sites to keep them from getting washed away. Then the inland in some of these sensitive military sites where we have radars that detect ballistic missiles, and at air bases with some of the most sophisticated fighter jets the Air Force has, there's permafrost that's melting and sinking underneath buildings. It's causing a lot of trouble up there and they're spending tens of millions of dollars to deal with that. Taylor Wilson: How are these changes affecting the ways the Pentagon operates in this region? Tom Vanden Brook: They're having to come up with different engineering fixes for some of these bases, particularly Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, where they have to scoop out ground that had been permafrost that's defrosting in order to build that. So they're digging down deeper to find solid dead rock or solid frozen ground, and then filling in with gravel, putting in piers, all sorts of different things that they're doing. As well, they're doing in more extreme cases, freezing the ground year round in order to maintain the hangers that they have and that sort of thing. Taylor Wilson: What's the cost, Tom, to some of these projects? Tom Vanden Brook: Well, it's been tens of millions of dollars in some of them. Overall, there's an increased interest in building in the Arctic, and that's part of the reason that we were up there to do the story. There's concern about that Alaska would be an avenue of attack, according to the Pentagon's Arctic Strategy, for adversaries like China and Russia. There are direct homeland security implications. They're sending up more troops, more aircraft, and that sort of thing. Taylor Wilson: Why is safeguarding the Arctic so important, Tom, to national security? Tom Vanden Brook: In Pentagon's own Arctic Strategy, it's an avenue of attack for potential adversaries. It also sits in a strategic spot that allows the Pentagon to move troops and material from the Pacific to Europe. It's a strategic area and it would be the first place that attacks probably would be launched toward the United States. It has sophisticated radars and missile interceptors, so there's a lot going on up there. Taylor Wilson: Tom Vanden Brook covers the Pentagon for USA TODAY. Thanks, Tom. Tom Vanden Brook: Thanks, Taylor. ♦ Taylor Wilson: Texas border control policies are being heavily criticized after a state trooper said that employees were told to push migrants \"back into the water\" of the Rio Grande when they reached the American side of the river. The criticisms come after reports were published on Monday by Hearst Newspapers, quoting an email sent by one trooper and backed by another that migrants lives were being put in danger by Gov. Greg Abbott's border security initiative called Operation Lone Star. The trooper who's a medic, and also said he supports the initiative overall, listed several incidents in the Del Rio area earlier this summer when migrants were distressed. He said five migrants drowned in the river and others were injured by razor wire installed along the Rio Grande. Others included injured children, a pregnant woman who miscarried, and some not given water or proper medical care despite intense heat. The trooper added, \"I believe we have stepped over a line into the inhumane.\" In a news release earlier this week, Abbott said no policies have been implemented that would lead to the mistreatment of people attempting to cross without legal authorization. ♦ The World Cup is here. The biggest women's soccer tournament in the world kicks off in Australia and New Zealand today, and the US team will begin their tournament tomorrow night versus Vietnam. Ahead of the cup, I spoke with USA TODAY Sports Columnist Nancy Armour just minutes before she boarded a flight for Auckland. Thanks for hopping on the show, Nancy. Nancy Armour: Thanks for having me. Always happy to talk about women's soccer. Taylor Wilson: Yes. Well, there are a number of firsts at this World Cup. Nancy, what are they and how has this tournament evolved since its inception in 1991? Nancy Armour: Where do we begin? Just even looking at the number of teams, this is going to be the first tournament with 32 teams. They're eight teams that are making their World Cup debut this year. It's the first time it's being held in the southern hemisphere. It's the first time the Women's World Cup has been co-hosted by two countries. Japan and South Korea co-hosted the men's tournament in 2002. It's just grown exponentially. When the first World Cup was played in 1991, it wasn't even called the World Cup. I think it was like the Women's International Championship or some weird name, because FIFA didn't want to call this the World Cup. So clearly the game is advanced that this is, I would argue, the premiere event in women's sports. Taylor Wilson: The US is going for a three-peat, something that hasn't been done before. You wrote a great piece about how the team passes its winning culture from one generation to the next. How do we see that at play with this team? Nancy Armour: Well, there are 14 players who have never played at a World Cup before, 12 who are going to be making their debut in a major international tournament, which is astounding given that there are only 23 players on the team. So you have this influx of new talent, and don't get me wrong, some of these players are really, really, really, really good. But they have to kind of be shown the lay of the land. That is something that going all the way back to the early 90s. I jokingly asked a couple of players, I'm like, \"Is there a handbook that you're given when you get to camp the first time, and are you shown a video?\" It's not a case like that. It's just the atmosphere, the attitude, the intention is made clear that this is a team that wins and anything less than that is not acceptable. Taylor Wilson: On the US team, who are some of the major players that you're keeping an eye on at this tournament? Nancy Armour: Among the veterans, it's going to be Alex Morgan, goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, Julie Ertz in midfield, Kelley O'Hara and Megan Rapinoe. O'Hara and Rapinoe will probably have more limited roles than we've seen them in the past. The young stars I would keep an eye on are Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman. Sophia Smith's last year was the youngest player to lead the US women in scoring since that woman named Mia Hamm way back when, so that's a pretty good credential to have. She was also the NWSL's MVP last year. Then you've got Naomi Girma who was already, in only her second year as a professional, is already one of the best defenders in the world. Just you've got a lot of young new talent. It's going to be fun to watch them. It's also going to be fun to get to know them. Taylor Wilson: Outside of this US team, who are some of the teams and players that folks should keep their eyes out for? Nancy Armour: A lot of the usual suspects. Obviously England, which won the European championship last year; Germany, which is a two-time World Cup champion and was runner up at Europeans last year; Canada, the reigning Olympic champions; France, Brazil. The big question mark is going to be who's got the depth to survive. England, like I said, they were probably my co-favorite with the US, but they lost three of their best players to injury, including their captain. Does any other team have the depth to be able to hang with the US? Because, yeah, US has had some serious injuries, too, but they have the depth to adapt to those. Taylor Wilson: And VAR, everyone's favorite word, or video assistant referee, is back at the World Cup. But there are some changes here, Nancy. What can we expect? Nancy Armour: It seems like a no-brainer. If you have watched college football or the NFL, you know you're going to hear this and think, why did it take until now? They're actually going to announce both in the stadium and on the broadcast what the VAR decisions are. So they will tell you that, yes, that was a handball or, no, the goal doesn't count because it was offside, or da, da, da, da. They'll say who the player was, who committed the offense, and explain it, which is stunning to an American audience, because that's what we've come to expect from watching American football, but this is the first time ever that it's going to be done that way at a World Cup. Taylor Wilson: Nancy Armour, thanks so much. Nancy Armour: Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson: You can tune in tomorrow night at 9:00 PM Eastern time on Fox. Thanks for listening to 5 Things.

[+] tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris International, in Neuchatel, western Switzerland. Big tobacco companies moved on October 11, 2018 to counter the hard line taken by a global tobacco control treaty, including its decision that new \"vaping\" products should face the same restrictions as cigarettes. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images The American multinational tobacco company, Philip Morris, is set to acquire the Israeli-based cannabis inhaler company Syqe Medical for up to $650 million, making it one of the largest companies in the global cannabis space. As first reported by the Israeli news media outlet Calcalist , Philip Morris plans to invest $120 million initially to aid Syqe Medical in obtaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its inhaler. If the inhaler passes clinical trials and receives FDA approval, Philip Morris will acquire all the shares of Syqe Medical for $650 million. This acquisition will be carried out through Philip Morris' subsidiary, Vectura, which focuses on inhaler technology and was purchased for $1.44 billion in 2021 as part of the company's strategy to shift towards smoke-free alternatives. The deal with Syqe would make a significant step forward for the tobacco multinational to penetrate the cannabis industry. As reported by several news media outlets, if the company achieves the $650 million valuation, Syqe will enter the league of the top ten largest cannabis companies worldwide, alongside industry giants like Tilray and Aurora. Philip Morris already invested $20 million in Syqe in 2016, acknowledging the promise of their innovative approach. Syqe's primary product is a metered-dose inhaler designed for pain reduction treatment using medical cannabis. The key innovation lies in Syqe's inhaler, which utilizes the raw inflorescence of the cannabis plant instead of its processed products. Additionally, the inhaler enables precise measurement of the dosage intended for each patient. MORE FOR YOU New Apple Exclusive Reveals iPhone 15 Design Surprise The Worst Scene From The Flash Is Now Going Viral 2023 Layoff Tracker Microsoft Cuts More Staff Report Says Founded by Perry Davidson in 2011, Syqe has received investments totaling $83 million , representing over eight years of development. During this period, the company obtained a permit to import medical cannabis for research purposes from the Dutch company Bedrocan Cannabis Corp. Syqe's cannabis inhaler was officially launched in 2019 and marketed and distributed by the Israeli pharmaceutical company Teva, and it is currently available in Israel and Australia, priced at approximately $550. According to official data, there are 125,099 patients in Israel as of the beginning of July. However, according to the Israeli magazine cannabis.com , only a small number, fewer than 100 patients, purchase Syqe's inhaler products regularly. In 2021, Canada granted approval to Syqe's medical cannabis device, but it appears that the product has not yet been introduced to the market. In February, Syqe Medical made an agreement with the Israeli Ministry of Defence to provide the SyqeAir Inhaler and Cartridges to veterans who are prescribed medical cannabis for inhalation. Philip Morris's potential acquisition could be one of the most significant in recent years, indicating the increasing importance of medical technology in Israel's healthcare sector. As well as Philip Morris, other tobacco multinational companies have been exploring investments in the cannabis industry in the last few years. Among them, the British multinational tobacco company Imperial Brands invested in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies (OCT). Altria Group acquired a 45% stake in Cronos Group for about $1.8 billion; however, it has been recently reported that Cronos Group is exploring potential sale options. Imperial Brands invested $123 million in Auxly Cannabis Group, and BAT launched its first CBD vaping product and made a $25 million investment in Trait Biosciences, a Canadian company focusing on CBD-based beverages. However, the interest of the tobacco industry's key players in the cannabis space is evident not only in business operations but also in lobbying efforts to advocate for cannabis legalization in the United States.

I write about the marketing change agents challenging the status quo Following Jul 20, 2023, 06:00am EDT | Press play to listen to this article! Got it! Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Pretesting ads can identify hits versus flops before media dollars are wasted. getty Can better advertising improve brand results? If it can, then how does a marketer systematically improve creative effectiveness? And what is the key to an effective ad anyway? These are the questions I posed to CMOs at Pepsico and Boston Beer and to the founder of ad testing pioneer System 1. Jane Wakely, chief consumer and marketing officer at Pepsico , responded, “We know that for effective ROI, both short term and long term, creative effectiveness is the number one driver. Creative effectiveness has a significant multiplier impact on performance and growth.” Lesya Lysyj, CMO at Boston Beer Company , echoed that perspective, “ In the beer category, it's all about the brand image. It's what you're holding in your hand in the bar with your friends, it says something about you. So advertising effectiveness is actually a critical part of growing and being successful in brands.” John Kearon, founder and executive president of System 1 Courtesy of System 1 Group What does science tell us about the key to effective advertising? According to John Kearon, founder and executive president of System 1 Group (formerly Brain Juicer), “It's the emotional response, the resonance that the ad creates that will predict your short term sales, but more importantly, the long term brand increases.” Pepsico’s Wakely concurred, “I believe fundamentally in System 1’s neuroscience in terms of defining how human beings work. It tells us that we actually respond emotionally, we make decisions emotionally. So advertising needs to create an emotion in order to cut through.” Kearon founded his company to predict which ads would effectively get audiences to respond emotionally before clients spent, and potentially wasted, millions of dollars in media. After testing hundred of thousands of ads, he believes he can predict which ads will be famous and which ones will flop. He shared, “It's about prediction, but it also about helping agencies and clients improve their work and do great work that gets a return.” Lysyj agreed, “We actually pre-test rigorously. We figured out that we can test three or four ad ideas before we even go into production of the work. And based on the learnings, it can help us with identifying which ad idea might be more successful than others.” Jane Wakely, chief consumer and marketing officer at Pepsico Courtesy Pepsico MORE FOR YOU New Apple Exclusive Reveals iPhone 15 Design Surprise The Worst Scene From The Flash Is Now Going Viral 2023 Layoff Tracker Microsoft Cuts More Staff Report Says Wakley shared an example of how this worked for Pepsico’s Lay’s brand. “We sponsor many sports teams and a particular one in the Champions League. The Champions League attracts billions of consumers to watch it every year and we know that a lot of people enjoy snacks and beverages during the match. It's a social occasion. So the strategic business imperative was to mentally link Lay’s to that occasion of watching sport. Our team came up with this great creative idea, No Lay’s. No Game., which was, if you don't have Lay’s, you just won't enjoy the game to the max. They developed several executions. The first time I saw the executions against that strategy, I said I could recognize the strategic intent, but it just didn't move me or entertain me sufficiently. I just didn't think it was going to cut through and as a result not be understood. And that's exactly what we learned through testing. We learned which of the executions were having more emotional responses, which part of the ad was having more emotional response. That enabled the team to go back into the editing suite. We had to evolve the storytelling in a way that really grabbed attention up front, and then surprised and delighted the consumer and ended on a real high, which made it have much more cut through and much more brand distinction and ultimately be a very successful performing campaign for us.” Lesya Lysyj, CMO at Boston Beer Company Courtesy Boston Beer Lysyj had similar experiences. “Two years ago, we did this spot for Samuel Adams, which was ‘the cousin from Boston’ breaks into a company that makes robots and he has a party with the robots. It pretested as the number one spot with System 1. It got on top of many of the top 10 lists. We got 2 billion PR impressions for it. So by all accounts, it was a success.” But not all the company’s creative executions pretested as well. She added, “Pretesting has helped us understand that sometimes the ads, especially 15 second spots, are too complicated. Too many cuts, too many people, the story is hard to follow. So I would say one of the big learnings is to simplify, simplify the story so that the viewer can actually absorb the story and get the emotion out of it. It gives you a better score. And in market, it actually gives you better results. The other learning is branding in the first four seconds for 15 second spot, which agencies sometimes don't like. But when you see enough spots you've put in pretesting and you realize you need to get the branding registered with the consumer early. There is so much noise out there! It is a very smart thing to get the brand registered early. It seems like a simple thing. But…” Getting ad agency creatives to embrace pretesting to improve effectiveness is not an easy task. Kearon elaborated, “Creatives hate quantitative ad testing with a visceral passion. It's really that strong, because they've been on the receiving end of approaches which just never reflect that creative magic. It's far too rational. It takes time, effort, and empathy to demonstrate that we're on the side of the creative angels. But that doesn't mean that we're just going to say yes to every interesting creative idea. There are lots of interesting creative ideas that just don't resonate with the audience. However, it's a necessary but not sufficient condition. We can actually predict which ads will be famous and which ones you can improve. You have to spot the ideas that have potential, and then work together with the agency and the client in collaboration, to keep evolving it, iterating it until you get something great.” But ad testing isn’t the magic cure for improving creativity, according to Wakely. “I have quite a balanced view on testing. Testing has its place, but it doesn't replace experience and risk taking. So for me, the most important thing in terms of really embracing creativity, is building deep relationships and trust with your agency partners, really understanding the human job to be done and the tension you're trying to solve, which leads to a business outcome. In that sort of partnership, I didn't think testing can tell you when you're onto a big creative platform that's going to last a decade. You need to develop experience, partnership, risk taking to develop a big creative platform. One example from my time at Mars was Snickers’ ‘You aren’t you when you're hungry’. That is a creative idea that's gone across the world, has lasted more than a decade, has won so many awards, but most importantly, driven the business. When you develop a creative idea that powerful, that simple, that spurs creativity across the world. Time and time again, I think that is about experience and trust. So developing the original creative idea and the big creative platform, it's hard to test your way to get to that. What you can do is test the execution on whether the execution delivers on the big idea. Marketing is fundamentally an art and a science and data has its role. But intuition and creative leaps are also deeply human. It's the combination of those two things that can create magic. And testing can help you more with the second thing rather than the first thing.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn . Check out my website .

            "content": "After a few months in beta, WhatsApp has launched its first official Wear OS app. That means anyone with an Android smartwatch will be able to download WhatsApp, and use their watches to communicate with friends and family without needing their phone. WhatsApp for Wear OS was originally announced at Google I/O back in May , but now Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced (via TechCrunch ) the app is now rolling out across the world. The app is only available if your watch runs Wear OS 3 or higher, but offers support for text, voice and emoji-based messaging as well as actual voice calls. Just like you can on the WhatsApp smartphone app. What’s more, all this works even if your connected phone isn’t within range. That’ll be especially useful for anyone with an LTE-equipped smartwatch like Google’s own Pixel Watch. Interestingly this puts Wear OS at a distinct advantage compared to the Apple Watch . So far Apple’s smartwatch doesn’t have a native WhatsApp app, which limits what iPhone owners can do on their wrist. All you can really do is check and respond to incoming messages, provided your notification settings are set up correctly, with no option to initiate conversations or calls from your wrist. Not that Apple Watch users are likely to switch platforms for a single app. Not all of the best smartwatches for Android are powered by Wear OS, but there are still plenty of options if you want WhatsApp on your wrist. The Google Pixel Watch is the obvious one, as are the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 5 . So if you’re a big WhatsApp user, and value the ability to use your watch in place of a smartphone, then you’ll want to head over to Google Play to get things set up.",

(Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) Getty Images Australia captain Sam Kerr has been ruled out of their first two Women’s World Cup matches after getting injured in training, the team announced on Thursday, shortly before their tournament opener against Ireland. “Sam Kerr is unavailable tonight after she picked up a calf injury at training on MD-1 (a day before matchday)” the team said on Twitter. “Sam will be unavailable for the next two matches with the Matildas Medical Team to re-assess her following our second group stage match.” Forward Kerr was named on the bench in Australia’s squad for the game against Ireland, which will be played later on Thursday in Sydney. She will also miss next Thursday’s game against Nigeria. Kerr, in a post on Instagram, said: “Unfortunately I sustained a calf injury yesterday in training. I wanted to share this with everyone so there is no distraction from us doing what we came here to achieve. “Of course, I would have loved to have been out there tonight but I can’t wait to be part of this amazing journey which starts now.” Mary Fowler was chosen by coach Tony Gustavsson to start up top with Caitlin Foord for Australia’s opener against Ireland, which is expected to attract the biggest crowd for a women’s football game in Australia.

Big Blow Kerr’s absence will be a big blow to the Matildas, who are touted among the title contenders at the World Cup, which will run from July 20 to August 20. The Matildas are in a very difficult Group B with World Cup debutants Ireland, Olympic champions Canada as well as Nigeria. Australia’s best finish so far has been the quarter-finals, which they reached on three occasions, in 2011, 2015 and 2019. Kerr is the poster girl for this year’s World Cup Down Under, leading the Matildas side. The 29-year-old Chelsea forward has made 168 international appearances for Australia, scoring 63 goals, and has been the captain since 2019. Kerr had headed to the World Cup after helping her club Chelsea win the Women’s Super League and the FA Cup in the 2022-23 season. With 12 goals, Kerr was fourth in the WSL’s top-scorers list this time. Her skill, experience and goal-scoring acumen make her one of the most dangerous forwards. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

            "content": "iOS 17 adds a feature to Messages that just might come in handy if you ever run into trouble getting from Point A to Point B. And if nothing else, it will provide some extra peace of mind to you and your loved ones. The feature's called Check In, and it allows you to let people that you message with when you've arrived somewhere safely. Even better, the Check In feature that's part of iOS 17 Messages works with very little intervention on your part — all you have to do is start a Check In and begin your journey. Check In automatically lets other people know when you've arrived or if you've been delayed. Should you experience any delay in your travels, Check In will ping you to see if you want to tack on extra time to your trip. If you don't respond, the feature will alert the people you're sharing with, providing them data on your last location. (You'll be able to determine just how much data gets shared.) Check In is part of the iOS 17 update coming to iPhones in the fall, but you don't have to wait until then to try out, so long as you install the iOS 17 public beta that's now available for download. You and the person you're checking in with both need to be running iOS 17 on your phones, and you'll need to have Location Services enabled. Here's our step-by-step guide on how to use Check In in Messages on your iPhone. In the Messages app, go to the conversation with the person you want to check in with. Tap the plus button (+) to the left of the text field. Scroll through the menu of iMessage apps that appears and select Check In . If this is the first time you're launching Check In, you'll see a series of screens explaining the feature to you. The most relevant screen will prompt you to choose how much information you share with people . The Limited option shares your current location and details about the battery status and network signal for your iPhone and your Apple Watch (if you're using the latter). The Full option includes that data plus the route you've taken and information on your last iPhone unlock or Apple Watch removal. Tap Continue after you've made your selection, and on the final screen of the Check In tutorial, tap Send a Check In to continue . You can always change what you want to share with people you check in with. We'll walk through those steps after we show you how to use Check In. You'll need to tap the blue arrow in the text field to send your Check In . You can also tap the edit button to change your destination or set your Check In to a specific time. (We'll show you how in a little bit.) Once you send your Check In, a text will appear in your conversation that shows your destination and your ETA. From here on out, all you have to do is head to your final destination and Check In takes care of the rest. But if you decide to cancel your Check In, tap the Details button on the Check In message . You'll see a screen with a Cancel Check In option. That same screen also shows your destination and ETA as well as how much information you're sharing. If you get delayed on your journey, you'll receive a prompt from Check In to add time to your trip. If you don't respond within 15 minutes, Check In will alert the people you've checked in with, sending the location data you've agreed to share. Once you do add time, your ETA will be updated . This step requires you to do nothing more than arrive safely. Check In will come to an end , and you'll stop sharing your data. The person you're sharing with will get a notification once you've arrived at your destination, and the status of the Check In in your conversation will update to show that you made it safely. In the example above, Check In automatically detected that I was heading home. But what if you had a different destination in mind or you wanted to tie your Check In to a specific time? It's easy to edit that before you send your Check In out. Starting with Step 3 from above, tap on the Edit button in the Check In window. To change your destination, make sure the top tab shows When I arrive . Tap Add Desintation . On the ensuing screen, type in your destination in a search bar. Once you've selected the proper destination, tap Done . To set your Check In to a specific time, tap the After a Timer Tab . Use the Timer menu to select when the Check In should end and tap Done . You're only asked if you want to share Limited or Full data the first time you start a Check In. After that, your initial choice is the default option. If you want to change that, you'll need to head to the Settings app. Launch Settings , and select Messages. Scroll down to the Check In section of the Messages app and tap Data . On the ensuing screen, choose between Limited and Full , then tap the back arrow in the upper left to save your choice. And that's all there is to managing Check In. But we've got more on Apple's latest iPhone software update based on our hands-on time with the iOS 17 public beta . We can show you how to set up StandBy mode as well as how to enable the iPhone camera level . If you want to know about the new features in iOS 17 Safari, we can tell you how to set up browsing profiles and how to get Siri to read articles to you in the Safari app.",

On November 13, 2020, the Consultative Committee noted that our country is still in a health emergency. If the number of contaminations is down slightly, the virus remains widespread, showing a cumulative incidence in 14 days of 1,232 confirmed contaminations per 100,000 inhabitants per day (figures from 12 November). (Photo by Thierry Monasse/Getty Images) Getty Images Vianova, the mobility data analytics platform, has inked a deal with Brussels to help city authorities manage the fleets of e-scooters on their streets. Brussels, like many major European cities, has seen an influx of e-scooter and bike sharing companies. Several operators, including Dott and Bolt, have fleets in the city. Often touting their convenience, these companies have also faced a backlash from residents over the years regarding dangerous riding and reckless parking, leading to city officials clamping down on the vehicles. To help address that problem Brussels Mobility, the city’s transport agency, has enlisted the help of French start-up Vianova . It has developed a software platform for city authorities and companies to manage the swathe of different transport options that have overtaken cities in recent years, from e-scooter rentals to ride-hailing. These options have presented more variety to residents in how they commute and get around but it has introduced many more moving parts to manage across a city, coupled with existing traditional public transport.

The contract is for one year with the potential for an additional three years. \"Brussels is one of Europe’s growing city hubs and the people that live there want a way to move around that is safe, sustainable and accessible,\" Vianova chief executive Thibault Castagne said. \"We’re delighted to reaffirm our partnership with Brussels Mobility and support the region to lead the way in the shared mobility transition by providing data-led insights that will reduce pavement clutter, make the streets safer, and encourage even more people to use shared mobility options.\" Martin Lefrancq, new mobility policy advisor at Brussels Mobility, welcomed the deal and said that shared mobility is \"the future of transport.\" This breaks from attitudes in some other locations in Europe that have sought to restrict e-scooters’ spread, such as in Italy or most infamously Paris, which held a referendum in April where residents voted to boot e-scooter sharing companies out of the city. Vianova meanwhile has been active for four years and has operations in 60 cities, recently expanding into the Middle East . It raised a €6 million Series round late last year. Follow me on Twitter .
